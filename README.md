### <a name='Python-Compatibility'></a>**Python Compatibility**
This bot is written entirely in python. tested versions are `python 3.11, 3.10, 3.9, 3.8, 3.7` while older versions should not cause any problem, we recommend using the latest version of `python3`.

### <a name='Dependencies'></a>**Dependencies**
This package requires the following packages:
* [pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram "Pyrogram Github") - Telegram MTProto API
* [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy "SQLAlchemy Github") - SQL & ORM Toolkit
* [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop "uvloop Github") - Asynchronus Programming
* [TgCrypto](https://github.com/pyrogram/tgcrypto "TgCrypto Github") - Secure Encryption for Telegram Protocols

## <a name='Instructions'></a>Instructions
To run the bot, you need to have a Telegram API ID and API Hash. You can get them from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org "Telegram API"). Then, you need to create a `config.py` file in the root directory of the project and fill it with the following information:

```python
     API_ID = # Your API ID
     API_HASH = # Your API Hash
     BOT_TOKEN = # Your Bot Token
     REPL_URL = # Your Replit URL
```
> ~~We recommend using a [Repl](https://replit.com/ "Replit") to host the bot but if you have your own server, replace `REPL_URL` with its URL.~~
>
> *[Replit](https://replit.com/) no longer supports Telegram bots, use another vps or hosting service.*

Then, you can run the bot using the following command:

```bash
    python3 -m uniland
```
